# ArdLeaf
An arduino library for reading information from a Nissan Leaf canbus.

Currently prints information about the car into the serial monitor (I'm working on an application to show this in a better form).

ArdLeaf uses files from the MCP_CAN library by coryjfowler https://github.com/coryjfowler/MCP_CAN_lib 
(These files come with the library, you don't need to download anything else).

## Installation
1. Download the ZIP from https://github.com/danmanmrdj/ardleaf/archive/master.zip
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Copy the "ArdLeaf" folder from inside the "Library" folder to your arudino libraries folder

This README will be updated with more information when I have time.
