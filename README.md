# ArdLeaf
An arduino library for reading information from a Nissan Leaf canbus.
Includes an application that displays information like speed, power consumption and current gear.

This is a personal project, so there isn't much documentation.

ArdLeaf uses files from the MCP_CAN library by coryjfowler https://github.com/coryjfowler/MCP_CAN_lib 
(These files come with this library).

This README will be updated with more information when I have time.

## Installation
1. Download the ZIP from https://github.com/danmrdj/ardleaf/archive/master.zip
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Copy the "ArdLeaf_Library" to your arudino libraries folder
